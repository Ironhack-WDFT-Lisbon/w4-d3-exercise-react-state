# React State

1. Address the issues in the file Counter.jsx to make the counter work
2. Refactor the Counter component to haver a handler function that increments the count
3. Refactor the Counter component so it's possivble to also decrement the count. Don't forget to check if state is equal to 0 as we don't want negative values
